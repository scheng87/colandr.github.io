### Searching for citations

#### Keywords

Enter the keywords for your search in the **<span style="color:blue">PLANNING</span>** section of colandr.

Terms can be entered alongside synonyms/alternative terms. Terms that have the same group assignment will be connected to each other with OR within a single set of parantheses. For example - for this set of keywords:

Terms related to marine habitats: ocean, sea, marine, coral reef, reef, beach

You may enter one of them as the term and the rest as synonyms 
Term = ocean
Synonyms = sea,marine,coral reef,reef,beach
Group = marine habitats

**OR**

you may choose to enter them as separate terms, connecting only terms that are very similar
Term = coral reef
Synonym = reef
Group = marine habitat
All other terms would entered as separate terms with no synonyms and group = marine habitat

Emerging applications of machine learning and text-mining may be able to help with this.
