# colandr

colandr ([www.colandrapp.com](http://www.colandrapp.com))is an open-source, open-access web-based platform for evidence synthesis and review projects. This platform aims to improve the efficiency and conduct of syntheses and reviews of text-based documents using a semi-automated approach that employs active machine learning and natural language processing. 

## How to use this guide

This guide is intended to get users up and running on their own synthesis project on colandr. It is split up by the workflow of a typical synthesis/review project consisting of searching for documents, screening them for inclusion, and coding meta-data.
